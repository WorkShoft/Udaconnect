*Persons API
** Port
5000
** Endpoints
*** /persons
*** /persons/<person_id>
*** /persons/<person_id>/connection
** Services 
*** ConnectionService.find_contacts()
This service calls the /locations/< to get a person's location from the Locations API.

* Locations API
** Port
5001
** Endpoints
*** /locations
*** /locations/<location_id>
*** /locations/<person_id>/[?start_date|end_date]

** Connection class
Both microservices consume the Connection class, which uses gRPC to encapsulate Person and Location details.

This is one of the major refactors to the original code, since it used SQLAlchemy models instead of gPRC messages.
